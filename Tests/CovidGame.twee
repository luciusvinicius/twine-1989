Good morning Steve, get ready for another day!

<<if getMask()>>

<<else>>
  [[Put a mask on|TryMask]]
<</if>>
[[Take a COVID test|TryTest]]
[[Go to work]]


:: RemoveMask
<<script>>setMask(false)<</script>>
Steve looks sort of troubled by the mask. Maybe taking it off a bit would be good.

[[Back|$stable_passage]]

/* this passage determines whether Steve puts on mask and shows the correct message */

    "Steve decides not to put on the mask. He read online that masks may cause you to die by choking in your own breath.",

  [[What the hell, Steve...|$stable_passage]]
<<else>>
  <<script>>addHealth(2)<</script>>

  Steve puts his mask on. Feeling protected already!

  [[Well done Steve!|$stable_passage]]
<</if>>

<<if getWariness() < CARELESS_THRESHOLD>>
  <<set _result to arrayChoice([
    "Screw tests! ...Is what Steve seems to think, as he puts the test he just opened straight in the trash.",
    "Steve looks at the swab in disgust. Seems there is no way he is sticking that up his nose."
  ])>>

  _result /* Display the resulting message */

  [[What the hell, Steve...|$stable_passage]]
<<else>>
  Steve reluctanly stabs his nostril with the swab and rummages around before he finally stops torturing his nose.

  And now, we wait...

  [[Wait for the result|WaitTest]]
<</if>>


:: WaitTest
The suspense is killing Steve. He feels fine, sort of.
So it should most definitely be fine....right?

[[See the results|ResultTest]]


:: ResultTest
/* determine whether Health is below COVID threshold */
<<if getHealth() < COVID_THRESHOLD>>
  It came back positive....

  It seems Steve wasn't careful enough. Right now, the best thing to do is to be extra careful and wait to get better.
<<else>>
  /* Steve is an idiot, so taking a negative test boosts his confidence */
  <<script>>addWariness(-5)<</script>>
  It's negative. Well that's good news, but remember, it might be a false negative. So there is no reason to be any less careful, right Steve? ...Steve?

  Steve, you look way more relieved than you should be...
