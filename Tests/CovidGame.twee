  It came back positive....

  It seems Steve wasn't careful enough. Right now, the best thing to do is to be extra careful and wait to get better.

  It's negative. Well that's good news, but remember, it might be a false negative. So there is no reason to be any less careful, right Steve? ...Steve?

  Steve, you look way more relieved than you should be...

Steve got it's usual bus to go to work.

  He straight up sat on the middle of a music gang playing some cool songs to listen to it.

  [[I mean, it is indeed a cool song.|Work]]
